        description: "Endodontic procedures refer to painless root canal therapy. Typically, when the interior of a patient’s tooth becomes infected, damaged, or diseased, general dentists will refer them to an endodontist. The endodontist will then be able to diagnose and treat the issues with the tooth’s sensitive interior, performing root canals when necessary. By offering such specialized endodontic procedures at your own practice, however, you can avoid outsourcing such services and expand your customer base.",
